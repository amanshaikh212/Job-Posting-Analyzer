# Job Posting Analyzer API

## 1. Problem Statement
Companies often need to understand current hiring trends and the most-in-demand skills in specific sectors to refine their
recruitment strategies. Manually analyzing thousands of job postings is inefficient and error-prone. This project aims to solve this problem by providing a simple API that automates the process of extracting, processing and analyzing job data to identify key skills and job titles.
