# Job Posting Analyzer API
## 1. Problem Statement
Companies often need to understand current hiring trends and the most in-demand skills in specific sectors to refine their recruitment strategies. Manually analyzing thousands of job postings is inefficient and error-prone. This project aims to solve this problem by providing a simple API that automates the process of extracting, processing, and analyzing job data to identify key skills and job titles.

## 2. Scope
This project focuses on building a functional prototype to demonstrate the core capabilities of a job data analyzer. The scope includes:

- **Architecture** : Designing a modular and scalable API structure.

- **Planning** : Defining the problem, technical stack, and data flow.

- **Development** : Implementing a FastAPI application with endpoints for data analysis. The web scraping will be simulated for this prototype to ensure the application is immediately runnable without external dependencies.

- **Testing** : Providing instructions on how to manually test the API endpoint.

- **Documentation**: Outlining the project setup, usage, and future enhancements in this README.md file.

## 3. Technical Stack
- **Language**: Python 3.9+

- **Web Framework**: FastAPI (for building the API)

- **Web Server**: Uvicorn (for serving the FastAPI application)

- **Libraries**: beautifulsoup4 (for HTML parsing and data extraction) and pydantic (for data validation, though not heavily used in this prototype).
